Internal:
- All items equally probable in item boxes for all places (no rubber-banding yet).
- Keyboard controls may need reworking.
- CPUs use items and weapons immediately, not strategically.
- CPUs can jump while turning without accidentally doing tricks, giving unfair advantage.
- All courses available from beginning.
- Turning speed not quite like SBK2 (no "edge").
- Tricks not adding up points for combos correctly.
- Camera still unhappy with looking backward (disabled for now).
- Prize vs Board Price is unbalanced (e.g. winning in Track1 allows you to buy two boards immediately).

Worlds and Maps:
- More of a reminder when building courses: Walls meeting tracks from bottom need to be dropped -0.15m to prevent bumping from above. (Possibly fixed after moving to Blender instead of ProBuilder?)
- All 5 tracks are in Blender but need drastic changes and updates (and themes).

UI:
- Maybe make a way to import custom face sprites? Or generate based on customization.

VFX:
- Daycycle working, but courses need night-lights.
- "Rolling" particle effect kind of vague, but should be replaced with animation anyway.
- Rocket particles kinda weird.

Audio:
- Missing movement and snow sounds.
- Missing player sounds (except tricks, but those need to be replaced).
- Audio can hear all players now, but not all CPUs.

Animation:
- All player animations.
- UI features.
- Replace coin/item box spin script with coin/item box spin animation?
